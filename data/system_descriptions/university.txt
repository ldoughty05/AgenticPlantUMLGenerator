University Course Registration System

This system manages student enrollment in courses at a university.

Students have a student ID, name, email, enrollment date, and declared major. Each student can enroll in multiple courses per semester.

Professors have an employee ID, name, email, office location, and hire date. Professors belong to exactly one department but can teach courses in other departments.

Departments have a name, building location, and budget. Each department has one professor serving as the department head.

Courses have a course code (like CS101), title, description, and credit hours. Each course belongs to one department. Courses can have prerequisites - other courses that must be completed first.

Sections are specific offerings of a course in a given semester. Each section has a section number, semester (Fall 2024, Spring 2025, etc.), meeting days, time, room number, and maximum capacity. A section is taught by one professor.

Enrollments track which students are registered for which sections, including their current grade and enrollment date. Students cannot enroll in sections that exceed capacity.
