There is a users table which holds sign in credentials for each user. Passwords are stored as a hash for security purposes and usernames should be unique. The active_sessions table keeps track of which users are online and the server uses it to map web sockets from user to user.  The dh_sessions table is for keeping track of which users have completed a Diffie-Hellman key exchange and are ready to send encrypted messages to one another. The messages table stores all messages so that they are available between sessions. The conversations table is a helpful addition to keep track of which users have talked to which other users.
