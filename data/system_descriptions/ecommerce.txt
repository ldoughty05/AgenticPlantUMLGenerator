E-commerce Order Management System

This system manages an online retail store where customers can browse products, place orders, and track deliveries.

Customers have accounts with their personal information including name, email, phone number, and can store multiple shipping addresses. Each customer can place many orders over time.

Products belong to categories (like Electronics, Clothing, Home & Garden). Each product has a name, description, price, SKU, and current stock quantity. Products can belong to multiple categories.

Orders contain one or more order items, each specifying a product and quantity. Orders track the order date, status (pending, shipped, delivered, cancelled), and which shipping address to use. Each order belongs to exactly one customer.

Payments are recorded for each order, tracking the payment method (credit card, PayPal, etc.), amount, payment date, and status. An order can have multiple payment attempts if one fails.

The system also tracks product reviews - customers can leave a rating (1-5 stars) and written review for products they've purchased.
