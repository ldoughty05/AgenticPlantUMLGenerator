There are several colleges in the university. Each college has a name, location, and size. A college offers many courses. Course#,
name, and credit hours describe a course. No two courses in any college have the same course#; likewise, no two courses have the 
same name. The college also has several instructors. Instructors teach; that is why they are called instructors. The same course
 is never taught by more than one instructor. Furthermore, instructors are capable of teaching a variety of courses offered by 
 the college. Instructors have unique employee IDs, and their names, qualifications, and experience are also recorded.
